    Sends a cancellation email to the user associated with a reservation.

    This Celery task retrieves the reservation by its ID, extracts relevant
    user and hotel information, and sends a personalized email notifying
    the user that their reservation has been cancelled.

    Retries up to 5 times in case the reservation is not found (e.g., due to
    eventual consistency or delayed database updates).

    Args:
        self: The task instance (used for retry logic).
        reservation_id (int): The ID of the reservation to cancel.

    Raises:
        self.retry: If the reservation does not exist, the task will retry
        with exponential backoff.
